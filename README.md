# According to the GDP all the States are categorized into 4 categories:

# Category 1:   'Goa', 'Sikkim', 'Kerala', 'Haryana'

There are only 4 states in this category, all of which are small (area-wise) and have good industrial base , agricultural, trade and real estate.

Trade and hospitality bisiness should be promoted further
Manufacturing should be further promoted

# Category 2:   'Arunachal_Pradesh', 'Punjab','Telangana', 'Gujarat', 'Karnataka','Maharashtra', 'Uttarakhand'

These states have relatively good per capita gdp and are drivcen by around equal percentage by industries and agriclture. These implies that these states have pool of talent to drive industries and agriculture. Because of the talent, other industries can take their advantage and set up good industries.
States like karnataka, tamil nadu , gujarat and maharashtra, which has huge coastal area can setup ports. Coastal area can help in harness clean energy and fisheries can be increased. Similarly, tourism industry should also be encouraged.
